 EMPIRE_DESIGN_hearthian:0 "Outer Wilds Ventures"
 EMPIRE_DESIGN_hearthian_desc:0 "Hearthian culture is genderless and places a strong emphasis on community and exploration. The Village is an extremely close-knit community and the only Hearthian settlement in the Solar System. Every member of the Village seemingly knows each other by name and young Hearthians are encouraged to interact with older Hearthians in their community. Hearthians constructed an observatory to both study the Solar System and act as a museum to display artifacts and information retrieved from space exploration. The Hearthian space program is overseen by Outer Wilds Ventures. Outer Wilds Ventures was founded by Feldspar, Gossan, Slate and Hornfels with the goal of training new astronauts to explore Solar System. Traditionally, every new recruit to Outer Wilds Ventures camps under the stars on the night before their first launch into Space. Astronauts who work for Outer Wilds Ventures can be found across the Solar System."

 EMPIRE_DESIGN_nomai:0 "Nomai Clans"
 EMPIRE_DESIGN_nomai_desc:0 "The Nomai race consisted of multiple clans. Each clan lived within a Nomai Vessel, a spaceship outfitted with an Advanced Warp Core that allowed the clan to explore the universe. The Nomai have an unquestionable aptitude for exploration and discovery. Every ten years, the Nomai clans would meet at a festival dedicated to celebrating their species' discoveries. Each clan sent an envoy to present their clan's discoveries since the last festival. The Nomai have a strong preference for non-interference and a strong desire to protect lesser-evolved life forms. The Nomai also show extreme care when mining for resources, taking precautions as to not disrupt the primitive life developing. The Nomai language is written in curving branches, often with each new branch coming from a different individual. The Nomai write the text by 'typing' it in on a staff-like tool and pressing the opposite end onto a surface. The text is sometimes written on walls; read off of circular pillars seen as hovering discs displaying different statistics (such as departure-arrival times after a warp); or accessed by a scroll, tablet, or 'recording' device. One strange observation is that some text is written as if it was said in the moment. This could mean that either this is their only way of communicating, or that they have some sort of voice-to-text device."

 EMPIRE_DESIGN_ghostbird:0 "The Strangers"
 EMPIRE_DESIGN_ghostbird_desc:0 "The Inhabitants originated from a terrestrial moon that orbited a gas giant in an unknown solar system. Upon detecting mysterious signals from the depths of space, their civilization immediately went to work to build an interstellar habitat and spacecraft capable of finding the signal's source. In the process of building this, they stripped their home moon of all its resources, leaving it completely barren. Terrified of the universe's potential for destruction, and determined not to let another species destroy them, the Inhabitants want only to be left alone and mourn the loss of their home."
